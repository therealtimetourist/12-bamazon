# bamazon
UCF Coding Bootcamp command line MySQL assignment

if you would like to recreate the sample database used in this project, use the bamazon.sql file in the workbench directory.

This project has two parts: 

a) node bamazonCustomer.js: The customer-facing UI for ordering products out of the database.

b) node bamazonManager.js: The management interface where products can be added and updated.

Before starting either tools, from the command line run the following command:

npm install

To quit the application, use CTRL+C.
